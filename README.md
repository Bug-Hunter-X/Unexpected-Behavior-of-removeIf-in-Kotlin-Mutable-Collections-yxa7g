This repository demonstrates a subtle but important difference in how `removeIf` operates on `MutableList` and `MutableMap` in Kotlin.  The seemingly straightforward use of `removeIf` can lead to unexpected results if not carefully considered. The `bug.kt` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.kt` offers an explanation and a possible workaround. This highlights the importance of understanding the iterator behavior in Kotlin's collection manipulation functions.  Always be mindful of how modifications during iteration can impact the overall outcome.
